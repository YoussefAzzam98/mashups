           <p> Shaghaf is an Egyptian alternative, indie-rock band formed in
             2016 in Cairo, Egypt. Translating to 'Passion', Shaghaf was founded
              by three friends as a mean of communicating their thoughts,
              feelings, emotions, and identities through what they are most
              passionate about: music.

              The band was founded by its three current members: Ahmed Mitry
              (guitar and lead vocals), Sara Fakhry (keyboard and vocals) and
              Youssef Azzam (drums and percussion). Mitry and Azzam had first
              met at a school talent show in 2013 after performing covers of
              their favorite songs. Cairokee were a main influence for them both,
               along with the various artists that appeared in Egypt after the revolution,
                and a source of inspiration to them during jamming sessions.

                Later on, Sara Fakhry joined the duo after asking her to take part in their
                performances at local events. The trio later branched out into a more
                independent project now known as Shaghaf.

              Shaghaf went on to perform at local
              events during 2016 before being selected by Sharmoofers to take
              part in Egypt's first, nationwide, Battle of the Bands competition.
              Shaghaf's debut single, "Helmak", was released on November 2016,
              helping them take the Egyptian, underground music scene by storm.
              They went on to win NYUAD's second edition of Battle of the Bands,
               establishing a solid presence in the UAE's local, underground
               music scene and recording their debut EP album. Recently, the band
              opened for the Wasla music festival in Dubai, UAE.

           <p> In May 2016, a nationwide competition known as Battle of the Bands
              took place in almost every city across Egypt. The purpose was to
              find the greatest Egyptian underground bands in the Egyptian
              underground music scene. Out of over 650 applicants, Shaghaf was
              handpicked by the infamous Sharmoofers to participate in the nationwide
               competition alongside 11 other bands. Being the youngest participants
              in the competition, Sharmoofers praised the young high school talents
              in Egypt represented by Shaghaf.

              The competition was comprised of four battles in different cities
              across Egypt with three bands per battle. Shaghaf took part in the
               competition's first battle in Alexandria, Egypt. Shaghaf toured the host city with their competition where
                 they got to perform around the different streets of Alexandria while
                  on a moving truck.

                    In their battle, Shaghaf came in second place with 39% of the
                     audience votes and a 3% difference between the winner, 3ala Kefna.
                     They managed to win the audience's votes but lost to the
                     judging panel's voting decision. Nevertheless, Shaghaf
                      managed to win the hearts of thousands across Egypt from the nationwide event.
